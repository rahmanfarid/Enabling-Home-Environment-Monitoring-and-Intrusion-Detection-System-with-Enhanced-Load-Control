# Enabling-Home-Environment-Monitoring-and-Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Enhanced-Load-Control
This project presents a smart home solution aimed at enhancing convenience and security. It incorporates remote load control via a Bluetooth module, allowing convenient management of home appliances such as lights and fans or other loads. The system includes a gas leakage alarm utilizing sensors for prompt flammable gas detection. Additionally, an anti-theft mechanism is implemented through a motion sensor to prevent intrusion. This comprehensive setup improves daily living while addressing safety concerns, making it particularly relevant in today's context.
